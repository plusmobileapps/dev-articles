# How to Change the Theme of Android Studio

Visit [Color Themes](http://color-themes.com/?view=index) and download your favorite theme. My personal favorite is [Solarized Dark](https://github.com/jkaving/intellij-colors-solarized). 

Once you have downloaded the `.jar` file, go to `File -> Import Settings...` and choose the file you just downloaded. Click ok to import the theme and then Android Studio will need to restart in order for the changes to take affect. 

**Option 1:** Install using "Import Settings..."
Go to `File | Import Settings...` and specify the intellij-colors-solarized directory or the settings.jar file. Click OK in the dialog that appears.

Restart IntelliJ IDEA

Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new color themes - > `Solarized Dark(Darkula)`
